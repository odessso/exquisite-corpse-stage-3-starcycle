## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

**stage one:**
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

in regards to the unconventional representation of time i wanted to explore the lifecycle of a star from birth to death.

the cycle goes as follows:
1. a nebulas - which is a cloud of gases and dust that is being condensed by gravity
2. main sequence star - otherwise known as supermassive  and has a stable core - it then expands and gets hotter - 90% of its life time
3. a red supergiant is then formed which has an unstable core and when that core implodes, collapses and bursts into a
4. supernova - freeing all elements created in its lifetime
5. whatâ€™s left of the star is a stellar black hole that has an intense gravitational pull

- the idea is that i will code a sequence of images to change in accordance to the life cycle of a star perhaps over a background of everchanging stars in a galaxy
- i ran into an issue when trying to make the sequence loop without deleting the background and the stars, i was also trying to figure out a way to delay the start of the star sequence without slowing down the gap currently between each star forming.
- the idea is that the little stars will show up, and then the 5 larger images will show up in succession along the line, and then they will disappear and loop again.
- after a lot of trial and error, i managed to find a way to achieve a similar result to what i was  initially looking for. 
- i tried to use the createGraphics function but in the end it seemed to be a little too ahrd for my current abilities.
- eventually i just decided to set up another counter that cleared the screen after 5 images showed up with a delay of two seconds, and then i put the star background into the draw function so it was always looping no matter what.
- this created an everchanging backdrop of stars alongside the cycle of planets which i honestly prefer to my original idea.
- i think this represents time due to the fact that stars can live for millions of years but they all follow a similar cycle no mattter what
- it's just a different type of lifecycle and explores the cosmos beyond us

*I absolutely loved Cat's take on the first stage of this brief, I found it unique and visually stunning. As I admired it so much, I chose to keep all of the images, colours and patterns the same. I only played around with the sizing of them just to fit the screen better. To incorporate interactivity to this sketch, I have added in an input box that invites the user to enter in a word of their choice. The code then uses a series of RiTa.js functions to determine what type of word it is e.g. verb, noun or adjective and displays one of the star images accordingly. If the user presses the enter button without inputting anything or inputs something the code cannot recognise as a word then the sketch will display an error message asking them to try again with a valid word. My thought process in doing this was that using an input box gives the user a lot of freedom in what they want to do/say but I can still categorise their inputs to display something from them. I wanted the users to experiment with different kinds of words to see the different outputs they could get. I chose to keep Cat's setInterval of drawing stars and apply it to every time the enter button is pressed because as previously mentioned, I loved the way it looked. I thought it was fitting to use it in this manner because then the user is amused and engaged by this animation everytime they press the enter button. Overall, I wanted this sketch to allow the user to be playful and experimental with their choices while seeing some truly beautiful images. Some challenges I came across while making this sketch was the setInterval stars being drawn over the images. I attempted to separate them and the images into different layers using the createGraphics element but in trying to learn and apply it, I found that it was causing me more issues than solutions. Therefore, I decided that, considering time constraints, it was wiser to leave this issue alone. Instead, I opted to decrease the timeframe for when the stars are drawn so that there wouldn't be as many covering the image.*

#### Overview:
- I also found Cat's style to be very visually and aesthetically appealing so didn't want to change the basis of the code too much. I decided to add some additional data that could be pulled up when the user inputs their word into the search bar. I hope that the data on biological specimines push the user to think about space less as a lifeless void and more like a pourous vessel that has the potnetial to hold life forms within it somewhere. I wanted to draw a connection between the imagery of these large nebulas and living life forms, playing on the idea that they co-exist.

#### Atributes:
- I kept with the theme of Roshni's code by having the data from the API's be drawn when the user inputs certain words into the search engine.
- I made the code refresh everytime that the user inputs a new word so that a new set of biological data is drawn form the API.

#### Problems Faced:
- I had a lot of trouble organising the data from the APIs. Originally, I attempted to use other types of API's for example "Worldwide astronomy data", "Asteroids, minor planets, and other objects" or "Scholarly information about high energy physics", however the data was organised very strangely and I had a lot of trouble actually drawing any of it to the screen. The best I could get was the biological speicimine data which I believe is actually a less obvious but still valid link between the living world and space.
- I had a lot of trouble getting the data to cycle through and change to different selections once a selection had been drawn to the screen the first time. luckily ChatGPT was able to help with this and I could get new data to appear when the user input another word. - its approach to doing this was to limit the data selection to 10 records and then from that selection choose one randomly fetched record.
- Using data within code isn't as easy for me as other forms of code, so in future exquisite corpse works I hope to make some more complex changes to the code I start with.
